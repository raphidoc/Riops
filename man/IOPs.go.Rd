\usage{
IOPs.go(
  report = FALSE,
  output.aTOT.COPS = FALSE,
  cast = "down",
  depth.interval = c(0.75, 2.1),
  a.instrument = "ASPH"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{report}{is a logical parameter indicating whether or not a
PDF report is produced using knitr.  Default is FALSE.}

\item{output.aTOT.COPS}{is a logical parameter indicating whether or not
the spectral absorption is needed for COPS processing. IMPORTANT: a COPS
folder with files preliminarly processed using the \pkg{Cops} package must
be present in the folder YYYYMMDD_StationXXX (see Details). The \pkg{Cops}
processing creates a file named absorption.cops.dat that will be automatically
edited if output.aTOT.COPS=TRUE. The default is FALSE.}

\item{cast}{If output.aTOT.COPS=TRUE, cast will indicate whether the down cast
or the up cast will be used to average the non-water absorption.
The default is "down"}

\item{depth.interval}{If output.aTOT.COPS=TRUE, this parameter will indicates
the depth interval for which the non-water absorption will be avaraged.
The default is c(0.75,2.1)}

\item{a.instrument}{If output.aTOT.COPS=TRUE, this parameter will indicate
whether the non-water absorption will be taken from the a-sphere (ASPH) or
the ac-s (ACS). The default is ASPH.}

\description{
This function launches the IOPs data processing,
which constists in applying various corrections and calibration
to measured inherent optical properties (IOPs) of seawater
constituents using various commercial instruments (see Details).
}
\details{
\code{IOPs.go} processes data files found in each directories specify in the file
named directories.for.iop.dat. NOTE: it is important to create one folder
per cast following this convention:
\itemize{
 \item{../YYYYMMDD_StationXXX/PACKAGENAME/}
 }
 where XXX is the station ID (with out "_" because it creates problems
 with the LaTex report) and PACKAGENAME is the name of the package.
 It could be anything.

For each directory specifyed in directories.for.iop.dat, four ASCII
files will be necessary in addtion to the files coming from the instruments
located in the directory. The ASCII files are:
\itemize{
 \item{cast.info.dat:}{ This file contains information relative to
 the current IOP profile;}
 \item{cal.info.dat:}{ This file contains information relative to
  the instrument calibration;}
 \item{instruments.dat:} { This is a list of instruments currently
 supported by \pkg{Riops}. User should put 1 when the instrument
 present on the optical package. The instruments supported are the
 following (as on June 1st 2016):
      \itemize{
      \item{HS6: } { A Hydroscat-6 from Hobilabs}
      \item{ASPH: } { An a-sphere from Hobilabs}
      \item{FLECO: } { An ECO triplet from Wet Labs. This was costumized
      for CDOM fluoresece with ex 379 and emission 420, 460 and 500nm}
      \item{CTD.UQAR: } { A SBE19+ CTD from Seabird }
      \item{CTD.DH4: } { A microCAT CTD from SeaBird }
      \item{ACs: } { An AC-s from Wet Labs}
      \item{BB9: } { A BB9 from Wet Labs}
      \item{BB3: } { A BB3 from Wet Labs}
      \item{FLBBCD: } { An ECO triplet from Wet Labs with
      chlorophyll fluorescence, bacskattering and CDOM fluorescence}
      \item{FLCHL: } { A chlorophyll fluorescence meter from Wet Labs}
      \item{LISST: } { A LISST from Sequoia;}
      }}
 \item{DH4.ports.dat:} { This file indicate on which port each instrument
 were attach to the DH4. It is therfore not necessary if the package does
 not include a DH4 to log the data}
}

If \code{IOPs.go} is run without these files, they will be created automatically
by the program and the user will be prompted to edit them.

Please read \code{\link{correct.merge.IOP.profile}} for a detailed
description of the content of cast.info.dat, cal.info.dat
and DH4.ports.dat.
